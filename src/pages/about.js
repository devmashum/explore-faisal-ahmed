            About:
I am a front-end web developer. I love using my creativity to make something new. That's why I enjoy working with React.js, Tailwind, JavaScript, and other web technologies. Over the last year, I have gathered knowledge in various parts of web development on my own. I have also attended two web developer bootcamps to further extend my knowledge in the web technology field. My ultimate goal is to become an awesome full-stack web developer who can create beautiful UIs and also handle the back-end smoothly. ðŸš€
